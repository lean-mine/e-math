# EMath

**EMath** is short for "Elementary Mathematics (for Lean)". You can also think it as "Easy Mathematics".

# Motivation

Lean has an amazing library of mathematical theorems a.k.a [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

But mathlib4 is mainly focus on research level mathematics.

Hence a library of some elementary, high school level mathematics might help beginners.

>For example, [NNG](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4) is very friendly to beginners.

# Guidelines
